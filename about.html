        We’re all the way across a pretty big pond, but that doesn’t mean that Italy, the place where this all 
        started, is ever far from our hearts and kitchens. It’s the country the Primucci family immigrated from, 
        and we do our best to honour Italy’s  heritage and culinary traditions with the food we make and the great 
        care we put into making it. We do that by not only sourcing the freshest, locally grown ingredients, but also 
        using the best recipes and traditional preparation methods. We invite you to Taste the Difference!

        Grazie, buon appetito!

● Panetteria: Our traditional bread dishes such as homemade baked garlic bread and freshly cooked panzerotti.
            ● Pasta and Sandwiches: Our delectable Italian sandwiches with veal cutlets, and pastas including lasagna, all made with freshly herbed tomato sauce.
            ● Salads and Sides: Top off a meal with a flavourful side such as crispy potato wedges or a freshly made salad with our signature vinaigrettes and traditional salad dressings.
            ● Chicken: Do you want to have something tender and saucy on the side? Give our chicken wings and fine breaded Pollini a taste…you won’t regret it
