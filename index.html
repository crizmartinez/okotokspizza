            <p>After watching his parents run a very successful pizza business in Calgary, Matt Cleveland 
               learned how to make people happy, one topping at a time. Opening the doors to Okotoks Pizza 
               in 2004, Matt has managed to evolve the fresh, traditional Greek-style pizza his family 
               perfected back in the mid 80s to a more modern and convenient comfort food for today’s family 
               on the go. Okotoks Pizzas are made with only the freshest ingredients like mozzarella, roma 
               tomatoes, made-from-scratch sauce and even features premium toppings like Sorriso Pepperoni, 
               salami from Valbella meats and a healthy Flax crust. You feel good about ordering it. You feel 
               good about eating it. And you feel even better knowing we're always ready to make you more.</p>
