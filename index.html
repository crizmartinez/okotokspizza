                <h4>Our Passion is Pizza</h4>
                <p>There are no short cuts when it comes to our passion. We pull out
                all the stops, giving you the ‘wow’ flavour, experience and
                consistency you not only want, but deserve. Our customers keep
                coming back, again, again, and again. We’re a small but nimble
                family-run take out and delivery pizza shop in Okotoks, Alberta.
                When we’re not scouring the globe (okay, the prairies) for the
                freshest, ripest and boldest ingredients, we’re crafting perfect
                pizzas for you and your family to enjoy. From hot Hawaiians and
                classic Canadians to crispy wings and decadent fudge brownies,
                everything at Okotoks Pizza is baked with love.</p>

                <h4>Only the best ingredients</h4>
                <p>After watching his parents run a very successful pizza business in
                Calgary, Matt Cleveland learned how to make people happy, one topping at
                a time. Opening the doors to Okotoks Pizza in 2004, Matt has managed to
                evolve the fresh, traditional Greek-style pizza his family perfected
                back in the mid 80s to a more modern and convenient comfort food for
                today’s family on the go. Okotoks Pizzas are made with only the freshest
                ingredients like mozzarella, roma tomatoes, made-from-scratch sauce and
                even features premium toppings like Sorriso Pepperoni, salami from
                Valbella meats and a healthy Flax crust. You feel good about ordering
                it. You feel good about eating it. And you feel even better knowing
                we're always ready to make you more.
