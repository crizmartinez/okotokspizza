        <H2>THE PEOPLE PLEASING PIZZA SINCE 1963!</H2>
        <p>
            Our story began in 1963 in when a young Italian family 
            opened the very first Okotos Pizza restaurant. 
            Our success continues as a direct result of our uncompromising 
            commitment to provide the people we serve with only the highest 
            quality products made from the finest ingredients
